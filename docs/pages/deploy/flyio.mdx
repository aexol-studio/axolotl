# Fly.io

We will always point to the official docs, but also provide you with an example
on how to do it faster with axolotl.

[Link to Fly.io docs](https://fly.io/docs/apps/)

## Step by Step

1. Visit [fly.io](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/) and install
   `flyctl`
2. Go into your Axolotl project
3. `flyctl auth login` - login to fly.io
4. `flyctl launch` - follow the instructions in CLI
5. `flyctl deploy` - deploy the app
6. By default flyctl will listen to PORT 3000, so we need to add secret to flyio `flyctl secrets set PORT=3000`. We can change it later if needed.

[Fly.io](https://fly.io/) will do everything for you, you just need to follow the instructions in the CLI.

After all the steps are done, you will have your app deployed and running.
