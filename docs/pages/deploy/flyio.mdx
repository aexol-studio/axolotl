## Step by Step

1. Visit [fly.io](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/) and install
   `flyctl`
2. Go into your Axolotl project
3. `flyctl auth login` - login to fly.io
4. `flyctl launch` - follow the instructions in CLI
5. `flyctl deploy` - deploy the app
6. Set your server port via secret, e.g. `flyctl secrets set PORT=3000`.

Follow the CLI prompts to finalize deployment.

After all the steps are done, you will have your app deployed and running.
