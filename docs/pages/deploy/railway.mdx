# Railway.app

We will always point to the official docs, but also provide you with an example
on how to do it faster with axolotl.

[Link to Railway.app docs](https://docs.railway.app/deploy/railway-up)


## Step by Step

1. Create project on railway.app
2. Connect the repository or repository sub-folder
3. Should work âœ¨


### Monorepo

If you are using monorepo with internal deps - the best way to build is to
change the default build command to:

```
npm run build --ws --if-present
```

or provide your own `Dockerfile`


### Gitlab CI

Just install the CLI and it will push the code

```yml
stages:
  - deploy

deploy-railway:
  stage: deploy
  image: ubuntu
  only:
    - pushes
    - main
  script:
    - apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl
    - curl -fsSL https://railway.app/install.sh | sh
    - railway up --service=$RAILWAY_SERVICE_NAME -d
```
