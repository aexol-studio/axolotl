# Railway.app

We link to the official docs and provide a quick Axolotl workflow.

[Link to Railway.app docs](https://docs.railway.app/deploy/railway-up)


## Step by Step

1. Create a project on railway.app.
2. Connect the repository (or a subfolder if using a monorepo).
3. Deploy âœ¨


### Monorepo

For monorepos with internal deps, change the default build command to:

```
npm run build --ws --if-present
```

Or provide your own `Dockerfile`.


### Gitlab CI

Install the CLI in CI to push the code:

```yml
stages:
  - deploy

deploy-railway:
  stage: deploy
  image: ubuntu
  only:
    - pushes
    - main
  script:
    - apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl
    - curl -fsSL https://railway.app/install.sh | sh
    - railway up --service=$RAILWAY_SERVICE_NAME -d
```
