# Testing

Axolotl encourages testing resolvers directly. You can reuse the same
type‑safe resolvers in tests and run them with your preferred framework.

Below we split the backend into small units and test with Node’s built‑in
`node:test` runner.

```ts filename="setup.ts"
export const axolotl = Axolotl(yourAdapter)<Models>();
```

```ts filename="resolvers.ts"
import { axolotl } from './setup.js'
export const resolvers = axolotl.createResolvers({
  Query: {
    hello: () => "World"
  },
});
```

So in this file we test

```ts filename="index.test.ts"
import test from 'node:test';
import assert from 'node:assert';
import { resolvers } from './resolvers.js';

test('Query.hello returns World', () => {
  const result = resolvers.Query.hello();
  assert.equal(result, 'World');
});
```

For end‑to‑end testing, start your server (Yoga/Apollo) and run full GraphQL
queries using your HTTP test client of choice.
