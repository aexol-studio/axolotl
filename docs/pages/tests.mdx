# E2E Type-Safe Tests helper

While having many testing frameworks already we are not going to include one
here. 

In this example I split the content of our backend to multiple files

```ts filename="setup.ts"
export const axolotl = Axolotl(yourAdapter)<Models>();
```

```ts filename="resolvers.ts"
import { axolotl } from './setup.js'
export const resolvers = axolotl.createResolvers({
  Query: {
    hello: () => "World"
  },
});
```

So in this file we test

```ts filename="index.spec.ts"
import { resolvers } from './resolvers.js'
// You can reuse resolvers in tests to test their resolving functions in any testing framework

describe("Tests for resolvers", () => {
    it("Returns world", () => {
        const result = resolvers.Query.hello()
        expect(result).toEqual("World")
    })
})
```

If you want to run full e2e tests on your server of choice - to test the server
additionaly you should write tests with full gql queries using your framework of choice
