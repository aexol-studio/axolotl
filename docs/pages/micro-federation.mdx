### Micro Federation
You can use micro federation feature in axolotl. Micro federation means all the modules are located within one project or one monorepo or are distributed as npm packages. Those axolotl projects are merged to the supergraph later. 

You can also run the project `examples/yoga-federated` to watch how
micro federation works!

To use micro federation you need to create config for your project containing
this kind of content:
```json [filename="axolotl.json"]
{
    "schema": "schema.graphql",
    "models": "src/models.ts",
    "federation":[
        {
            "schema":"src/todos/schema.graphql",
            "models":"src/todos/models.ts",
        },
        {
            "schema":"src/users/schema.graphql",
            "models":"src/users/models.ts",
        }
    ]
}
```

Inside this config main field `schema` and `models` specify paths for supergraph
schema and its models. Here is how the federation process works:

1. Take all the schemas from federation array and generate models file for each
2. Create supergraph schema from all the federation schemas.
3. Create models for supergraph

To run federated axolotls - each of folders, `users` and `todos` in our case has
to provide their own `resolvers.ts` files based on local models and `Axolotl`.
Then inside the main `resolvers.ts` file wee need to merge those subgraph
resolvers:

```ts [filename="src/resolvers.ts"]
import { mergeAxolotls } from '@aexol/axolotl-core';
import usersResolvers from '@/src/users/resolvers.js';
import todosResolvers from '@/src/todos/resolvers.js';

export default mergeAxolotls(usersResolvers, todosResolvers);
```

then you can use those resolvers as normal resolvers result.
