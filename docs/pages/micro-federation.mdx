### Micro‑Federation
Use micro‑federation to compose multiple Axolotl modules in a single project or
monorepo (or via npm packages). Individual schemas are merged into a supergraph
that your server uses at runtime.

You can also run the project `examples/yoga-federated` to watch how
micro federation works!

To enable it, configure `axolotl.json` like:
```json [filename="axolotl.json"]
{
    "schema": "schema.graphql",
    "models": "src/models.ts",
    "federation":[
        {
            "schema":"src/todos/schema.graphql",
            "models":"src/todos/models.ts",
        },
        {
            "schema":"src/users/schema.graphql",
            "models":"src/users/models.ts",
        }
    ]
}
```

`schema`/`models` point to the supergraph schema and its generated models.
Federation flow:

1. Generate models for each entry in `federation`.
2. Merge those schemas into the supergraph saved at `schema`.
3. Generate models for the supergraph.

To run federated axolotls - each of folders, `users` and `todos` in our case has
to provide their own `resolvers.ts` files based on local models and `Axolotl`.
Then inside the main `resolvers.ts` file we need to merge the subgraph
resolvers:

```ts [filename="src/resolvers.ts"]
import { mergeAxolotls } from '@aexol/axolotl-core';
import usersResolvers from '@/src/users/resolvers.js';
import todosResolvers from '@/src/todos/resolvers.js';

export default mergeAxolotls(usersResolvers, todosResolvers);
```

Use the merged resolvers as the adapter input, just like a single‑schema setup.
