<p className="w-full text-center p-8">Framework ensuring **GraphQL** Resolvers and arguments **type-safety**. Written in TypeScript</p>

## ðŸ«  How?

Axolotl provides **type-safety** and it is up to you to choose an adapter (or write your own).
Get more info in [Getting started](/getting-started) section
```ts filename="index.ts"
import { Models, Directives } from '@/src/models.js';
// choose your adapter
const { createResolvers,adapter } = Axolotl(yourAdapter)<Models, Directives>();

const resolvers = createResolvers({
  Query: {
    hello: () => "World"
  },
});

adapter({ resolvers }).server.listen(parseInt(process.env.PORT || '4000'), () => {
  console.log('LISTENING to ' + process.env.PORT || '4000');
});
```

```graphql filename="schema.graphql"
type Query{
    hello: String!
}
```
## ðŸ¤” Why? 

Writing GraphQL for backend developers is still complicated when you want to go schema-first instead of code-first. Moreover I felt like we need an **evolutionary** framework. 

For example using `apollo-server` but want to switch to `graphql-yoga` ? No
problem just change an adapter.

We know that when you **begin the project** - you don't know what will be the
best server technology and architecture.  

## ðŸ§Œ Who?

Me [aexol](https://github.com/aexol) is the author of the lib. I was in the type-safety rabbit hole while building [GraphQL Zeus](https://github.com/graphql-editor/graphql-zeus) a GraphQL Client downloaded almost Million of times. While maintaining zeus and developing together with all-the-time changing TypeScript is really hard. I discovered - I can write something simpler - much powerful, that community needs, that integrates with everything - using the same knowledge.
