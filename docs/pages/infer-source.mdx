# Infer Source Type

In GraphQL usually there is no way to know the source type from incoming data to
the resolver. This is because you as a developer control the way everything is
resolved.

```graphql filename="schema.graphql"
type Query{
  onlySomeCanPass: World
}
type World{
  restOfTheStory: String
}
```

So this way the type of source will contain some user data which is not known
when you look at the graph and it is internal backend information.

So imagine you create resolvers this way:

```ts filename="query.ts"
export default createResolvers({
  Query:{
    onlyUserCanPass: async (input,args) =>{
      const user = await getUser(input)
      if(!user){
        throw new Error("You shall not pass!!!");
      }
      return {
        userId: user.id,
        username: "Gandalf"
      }
    }
  }
})
```

So when we create a new resolver for World.restOfTheStory there will be
different stories for different users. So we need to know what has been returned.


```ts filename="world.ts"
import QueryResolvers from './query.js'
import { setSourceTypeFromResolver } from '@aexol/axolotl-core'

const convertSource = setSourceTypeFromResolver(QueryResolvers.onlyUserCanPass)

export default createResolvers({
  World:{
    restOfTheStory: async (input,args) =>{
      const user = await getUser(input)
      if(!user){
        throw new Error("You shall not pass!!!");
      }
      // this is type-safe now.
      const src = convertSource(input.source)
      if(src.username === "Gandalf") return "Fall down and return later"
      return "Go safely through the bridge"
    }
  }
})
```
