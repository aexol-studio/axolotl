It is eaaaaaaasy to run things locally. But when it comes to deployment, things
can go crazy. Here you get some recipies on how to start and deploy quickly to
most popular platforms.

Mostly your platform of choice need to just run the NodeJS server, but we will
try to describe other kind of deployments such as Docker and router based frameworks.

We added **many** recipes however so you can start really fast!
