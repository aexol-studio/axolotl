# Ai

Axolotl CLI enables to use prepared AI prompt to generate resolvers code and
(soon) generate test code for those resolvers

## Generate graphql schema 

Provide OPEN_AI_API_KEY env variable and run
```sh
npx OPENAI_AI_API_KEY=xxx axolotl gai  "schema for booking.com like system"
```

This command will generate the graphql schema

### Config params

**prompt_info** - you can add 'baked' additional prompt information into your
axolotl config file

```json
{
    "graphql_prompt_info": "use pipes",
    "agent_model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
}
```

Prompt info can be also a txt file for bigger prompts
```json
{
    "graphql_prompt_info": "graphql.txt",
    "agent_model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
}
```

## Generate backend resolver 

Given `schema.graphql`
```graphql
type User{
    username: String!
    posts: [Post!]
}
type Post{
    title: String!
    content: String!
    user: User!
}
```

Provide OPEN_AI_API_KEY env variable and run
```sh
npx OPENAI_AI_API_KEY=xxx axolotl ai path/to/schema.graphql User posts "resolver to list all the posts user has created use mongodb"
```

This command will generate the axolotl compatible typescript backend code for the resolver
and copy it to clipboard

### Config params

**prompt_info** - you can add 'baked' additional prompt information into your
axolotl config file

```json
{
    "prompt_info": "use postgres with drizzle library to manage database",
    "agent_model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
}
```
## Generate frontend react component 

This agent generates react components that communicate with provided backend. 

Given `schema.graphql`
```graphql
type User{
    username: String!
    posts: [Post!]
}
type Post{
    title: String!
    content: String!
    user: User!
}
type Query{
    posts: [Post!]
}
```

Provide OPEN_AI_API_KEY env variable and run
```sh
npx OPENAI_AI_API_KEY=xxx axolotl fai path/to/schema.graphql User posts "component showing list of posts with title and author username"
```

This command will generate the component


### Config params

**prompt_info** - you can add 'baked' additional prompt information into your
axolotl config file

```json
{
    "frontend_prompt_info": "use shadcn components: Input, Button, Select",
    "agent_model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
}
```


## Generate code
You can also generate typescript code - universal one for webhooks utility
functions etc

```sh
npx axolotl cai schema.graphql "stripe webhook to handle payments"
```
