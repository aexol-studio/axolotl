# Adapters

Adapters are the ones that transform your resolvers code into the actual GraphQL
Server. Main reason we have adapters in Axolotl is that we can write same code
for resolvers and there is very low migration effort if we want to change the
server library. Moreover you can run different GraphQL Engines for different
parts of your graph in future.

## Currently implemented adapters

- [GraphQL Yoga NodeJS](/adapters/graphql-yoga)
- [GraphQL Yoga Deno](/adapters/deno-yoga)
- [Apollo Server](/adapters/apollo-server)
- [StuccoJS](/adapters/stucco)


## How to write our own adapter

Every adapter eventually receives Record of Types with record of fields. What it
does need to do is to transform from the raw http input or your framework input
and provide a functions that consumes and/or runs the actual server.


```ts
/* eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any */
import { readFileSync } from 'fs';
import { AxolotlAdapter } from '@aexol/axolotl-core';
import { YogaInitialContext, createSchema, createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga';
import { createServer } from 'http';
import * as path from 'path';

export const graphqlYogaAdapter = AxolotlAdapter<[any, any, YogaInitialContext]>()((resolvers) => {
  const yogaResolvers = Object.fromEntries(
    Object.entries(resolvers).map(([typeName, v]) => {
      return [
        typeName,
        Object.fromEntries(
          Object.entries(v).map(([fieldName, resolver]) => {
            return [
              fieldName,
              (_: any, args: any, context: YogaInitialContext) => {
                return resolver([_, args, context], args);
              },
            ];
          }),
        ),
      ];
    }),
  );
  const schemaFile = readFileSync(path.join(process.cwd(), './schema.graphql'), 'utf-8');
  const yoga = createYoga({
    schema: createSchema({
      typeDefs: schemaFile,
      resolvers: yogaResolvers,
    }),
  });
  const server = createServer(yoga);
  return server;
});

```

As you may see in this yoga adapter is responsible for:
- starting GraphQL serviers
- merging the resolvers into yoga Object
- reading the schema
