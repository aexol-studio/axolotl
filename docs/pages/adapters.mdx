# Adapters

Adapters are the ones that transform your resolvers code into the actual GraphQL
Server. Main reason we have adapters in Axolotl is that we can write same code
for resolvers and there is very low migration effort if we want to change the
server library. Moreover you can run different GraphQL Engines for different
parts of your graph in future.
