## 🛫 Installation

To initiate a command, you must specify the `prefix` from the table above.

The `dir` argument is optional and represents the directory where the project will be created. If left unspecified, the project will be generated in the `default` directory.

```sh
npx @aexol/axolotl [prefix] [dir]
```

⭐ CLI already installed?

If you have already installed the CLI, you can use the `axolotl` command.

```sh
axolotl [prefix] [dir]
```

## 🛬 After installation

After installation, you can easily navigate to your project directory and execute `npm run build`.

When the build is complete, you can start the server by executing `npm run start`.

We have provided you with a straightforward example of a GraphQL server featuring a simple schema and a basic implementation, which operates on a `JSON` file as a database.

🎉 **Congratulations** you have successfully created your first GraphQL server with **Axolotl**. 🎉
