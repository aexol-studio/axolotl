## 🛫 Installation

To initiate a command, you must specify the `prefix` from the table above.

The `dir` argument is optional and represents the directory where the project will be created. If left unspecified, the project will be generated in the `default` directory.

```sh
npx @aexol/axolotl [prefix] [dir]
```

For example 

```sh
npx @aexol/axolotl create-yoga my-project
```

Will create the axolotl project using `graphql-yoga` engine inside `my-project`
directory - **simple**!

### 🦕 Deno
This is just a scaffold command but you can run it with deno to :D

```
deno run --allow-env --allow-write --allow-read npm:@aexol/axolotl [prefix] [dir]
```

## 🛬 After installation

After installation, you can easily navigate to your project directory and execute `npm run build`.

When the build is complete, you can start the server by executing `npm run start`.

We have provided you with a straightforward example of a GraphQL server featuring a simple schema and a basic implementation, which operates on a `JSON` file as a database.

🎉 **Congratulations** you have successfully created your first GraphQL server with **Axolotl**. 🎉
