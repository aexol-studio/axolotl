# Config

Most commands in axolotl are based on the available configuration in the project root folder. To generate the configuration file we can call the command

```sh
axolotl models
```

The arguments -m and -s are mandatory. If they are not provided as arguments, you can input them via standard input.

Based on the [beerpub-yoga example](/examples/beerpub-yoga) run `axolotl build`:

Axolotl will generate a configuration file named "configuration.json" which will contain the flags passed when building the models, an example configuration file may look like this

```json filename="axolotl.json"
{
  "schema": "schema.graphql",
  "models": "src/models.ts"
}
```

This guide should help you understand your Axolotl configuration. More detailed examples can be found in the Examples section.

## Micro federation

Config supports GraphQL Federation baked into axolotl. The main schema file is
generated then and becomes `supergraph`. The example how federation works in
Axolotl is used in [yoga-federated example](/examples/yoga-federated)

```json filename="axolotl.json"
{
    "schema": "schema.graphql",
    "models": "src/models.ts",
    "federation":[
        {
            "schema":"src/beers/schema.graphql",
            "models":"src/beers/models.ts"
        },
        {
            "schema":"src/shop/schema.graphql",
            "models":"src/shop/models.ts"
        }
    ]
}
```
