# Axolotl — Ideas To Build The Best Type‑Safe Micro‑Federation GraphQL Engine

These notes summarize what Axolotl already does well and concrete steps to make it a world‑class GraphQL server framework. I focused on: type‑safety end‑to‑end, first‑class micro‑federation, developer experience, performance/observability, and a compelling MCP story.


## What’s Strong Today
- Type‑safe resolvers: `createResolvers` + generated `Models`, `Directives`, `Scalars` with great DX.
- Adapter abstraction: Yoga and Apollo adapters with directive mapping support; Deno support present.
- Micro‑federation: `mergeAxolotls` to compose resolvers and `createSuperGraph` to produce a supergraph SDL.
- CLI ergonomics: `build`, `inspect`, `chaos`, codegen (incl. Zeus), “create-*” starters, watch mode.
- Smart utilities: `setSourceTypeFromResolver` for narrowing source types; middleware injection; directive pipelines.
- Early MCP: `axolotl mcp` exposes schema/operations to MCP tools.


## Opportunities & High‑Impact Enhancements

### Type‑Safety & DX
- Strongly‑typed context: allow declaring `Context` type per module and compose/validate it in the supergraph.
- Resolver coverage as a check: `inspect` returns JSON + exit codes; add GitHub check and PR annotations.
- Typed directives SDK: generate directive handler stubs with typed args and attachable schema transforms.
- Scalar mappers: generate a per‑schema scaffold for custom scalars (parse/serialize) with TS types + zod/yup guards.
- Generated resolver stubs: `axolotl codegen resolvers` to scaffold missing resolvers with typed signatures and TODOs.
- HMR‑style dev server: watch schema/resolvers and hot‑swap resolvers without server restarts (where framework allows).
- Error contracts: unify error shapes and surface them as typed results (Result<T, E>) or GraphQL‐friendly error helpers.

### Micro‑Federation & Modules
- Ownership & merge keys: add directive like `@owner(service: "users")` and `@merge(key: "id")` to control merge/deep‑merge.
- Conflict detection: extend `createSuperGraph` errors with actionable messages and codemod suggestions.
- Field‑level composition strategies: `@compose(strategy: UNION|MERGE|CONCAT)` to govern result merging per field.
- Remote modules: allow federation from npm packages or remote SDL URLs with caching and signature pinning.
- Module health: per‑module introspection, resolver coverage, perf stats; “module readiness” badge in CLI output.
- Federated context: well‑defined pattern to contribute/scope context pieces per module (and avoid collisions).

### Performance & Caching
- DataLoader factory: generate per‑type loaders from schema relations; easy batching hooks in adapters.
- Response caching: built‑in persisted queries + cache hints via directives (`@cache(ttl: 60)`).
- Cost analysis & limits: depth/complexity analyzer, configurable per‑role budgets; friendly errors.
- Execution metrics: per‑resolver timings, cold/hot cache ratios, and top N slow fields.

### Security & Governance
- Policy directives: `@auth`, `@rateLimit`, `@allow(role: ...)` with typed context guards and examples.
- Input validation: first‑class `zod` integration for inputs and custom scalars; fail fast with clear errors.
- Safe defaults: disable introspection in production, enforce allow‑lists for mutations, deny unknown headers.
- Schema lifecycle: diffing, deprecation reports, “breaking change” checks; `axolotl schema check --against <ref>`.

### Observability & Tooling
- OpenTelemetry: span per resolver, propagate context; exporters for logs/metrics/traces.
- Dev UI: small TUI/CLI to view resolver coverage, federation graph, hot spots; link to GraphiQL.
- Chaos v2: evolve `chaos` to actually execute randomized queries against the configured endpoint and assert type shapes.

### Adapters & Runtime
- More adapters: Helix/Envelop, Fastify, Express/Hono, serverless (Vercel/Netlify), Bun, Cloudflare Workers.
- Subscriptions: WebSocket + SSE support with typed payloads; example showing live queries.
- Deno parity: mirror Yoga features in Deno adapter; publish “deno deploy” example with KV/cache.

### Modularium
- Module registry: discoverable, versioned modules (npm scopes) + local templates; `modularium add users@^1`.
- Module tests: scaffold module‑level tests and example seeds; include resolver coverage gates.
- Docs generator: produce module README from schema/resolvers/directives automatically.


## Concrete Proposals (Short‑Term)

1) Resolver Coverage as a First‑Class Check
- `axolotl inspect --format json --fail-on-missing` for CI.
- PR annotation helper: show missing resolvers next to files.

2) DataLoader & Cache Directives MVP
- `@cache(ttl: Int, scope: PUBLIC|PRIVATE)`; Yoga/Apollo adapters read and set hints.
- `axolotl codegen loaders` creates typed batchers for IDs/refs; starter example wired.

3) Typed Directives SDK
- Generate directive handler stubs with typed args and schema transform wrapper.
- Provide examples for `@auth`, `@rateLimit`, `@uppercase` as cookbook.

4) Chaos Runner v2
- Execute randomized queries built from SDL against `--url`; optional auth headers.
- Output histogram of status codes, resolver timings (if telemetry enabled).

5) Adapter Add‑On: Subscriptions
- Add WebSocket server wiring to Yoga adapter (and Apollo where available) with a small demo.


## “MCP” For Axolotl

There are two complementary “MCP”s worth pursuing:

1) Model Context Protocol (already started)
- Today: `axolotl mcp <schema|url> [--endpoint] [-H ...]` exposes `schema.print`, `graphql.raw`, and one tool per Query/Mutation.
- Short‑term improvements:
  - Add selection‑set suggestions by introspecting field return types.
  - Tool metadata: include examples and argument shapes; auto‑docs.
  - Persisted headers profiles (e.g., `--profile dev`) loaded from `axolotl.json`.
  - Streaming responses for live queries/subscriptions where transport allows.
  - Packager: `axolotl mcp bundle` to produce a redistributable MCP server config for a project.

2) Minimum Complete Product (MCP) of Axolotl (aka MVP with teeth)
- Core: schema‑first codegen (models, directives, scalars), adapters (Yoga, Apollo), typed resolvers, middleware, directives.
- DX: `build --watch`, `inspect`, `chaos v2`, resolver stubs generator, scalar/directive stubs, starter templates.
- Micro‑federation: `createSuperGraph`, `mergeAxolotls`, conflict detection with clear errors, per‑module context composition.
- Observability: basic OpenTelemetry spans, console timing per resolver in dev, simple log integration.
- Security: `@auth` example directive with typed context; depth/complexity limits; persisted queries opt‑in.
- Docs & Examples: yoga, apollo, federated, subscriptions, Deno; cookbook for directives and caching.

This “complete” baseline is enough to win most greenfield GraphQL projects and be production‑credible.


## Longer‑Term Bets
- Remote federation & “edge‑modules”: compose npm/URL modules with signature pinning and verifiable checksums.
- Operation governance: automatic client schema generation (Zeus done), client contract tests, and change reports.
- Schema IDE integrations: Axolotl language server (LSP) for VS Code with diagnostics/quick‑fixes.
- Policy engine: Axolotl‑Shield style policies compiled to fast predicate functions with context typing.
- Smart caching: automatic entity cache keyed by `@merge(key: ...)` and invalidation hooks per mutation.


## Next Steps I Can Implement Incrementally
- Add `inspect --format json --fail-on-missing` and wire CI example.
- Add `@cache` directive wiring + Yoga cache hints example + docs.
- Provide `codegen loaders` (DataLoader templates) and an example integration.
- Add subscriptions to Yoga adapter with a runnable example.
- Enhance `axolotl mcp` with profiles, examples, and selection‑set suggestions.

If you want, I can start with the “inspect JSON + CI fail” and `@cache` directive MVPs to make measurable DX/production gains quickly.
